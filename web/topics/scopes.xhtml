        <h1>Scopes of Managed Beans:</h1>

        <p><b>@RequestScoped </b><br />
            A request scoped bean lives the duration of a single HTTP request/response cycle.<br />
            It is used for simple and non-ajax forms and presentations.</p>

        <p><b>@SessionScoped</b><br /> 
            A session scoped bean lives the duration of the established HTTP session <br />
            and exists across multiple HTTP requests.<br />
            It is used for client specific data, such as the logged-in user and user preferences.</p>

        <p><b>@ApplicationScoped</b><br /> 
            An application scoped bean lives the duration of the web application's run time, <br />
            it exists for all users interacting with the web application.<br />
            It is used for application wide data/constants, such as a dropdown list which is the same for all users.</p>

        <p><b>@ViewScoped</b><br /> 
            A view scoped bean lives as long as the user is interacting with the same JSF view <br />
            by postbacks which call action methods returning null without any navigations or redirects.<br />
            It is used for rich ajax-enabled dynamic views.</p>

        <p><b>@NoneScoped</b><br /> 
            A none scoped bean lives the duration of a single EL (Expression Language) evaluation <br />
            (the bean is destroyed immediately after evaluation).</p>

        <p><b>@CustomScoped</b><br /> 
            A custom scoped bean can be defined in custom map by the user.<br />
            It is used for special cases only.</p>
